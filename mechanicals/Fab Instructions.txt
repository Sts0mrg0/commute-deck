To Cut…

1 x Back Plate
1 x Top Deck
1 x Top Fascia - Gaps
2 x Spacer
3 x Spacer-Handle-Eyelist-WristRest
1 x Battery Support Trapezoid (can place DXF inside a larger part to save space)

Based on last time, that should fill most of the plywood. If there is any extra space, can you toss in more Spacers?

The plywood should have a label on it with thickness info. I /think it is .196” thick?
